    <h1>Football</h1>
    <h1>Basketball</h1>
    <h1>Track</h1>
    <p>Football is my favorite sport. I like how you can hit people with out getting in trouble.</p>
    <p>Basketball is my second favorite sport. Basketball is really fun and I enjoy playing it.</p>
    <p>Track is the third sport I play. It is my least favorite of the three but it is still fun.</p>
